      <h2 class="Intro"> Hi, I'm Laurel!</h2>
      <p>I'm a passionate and technically skilled Designer with experience
        creating internal and external communication collateral and providing design
        direction that fits with — and enhances — organizational brands. I pride myself
        in being an exceptional communicator, able to work with cross-functional teams
        and build loyal relationships with clients while collaborating on projects.
        I am fluent in the Adobe Creative Suite and have a growing knowledge in Marketing
         and User Experience. I enjoy hand lettering, illustration, comedy and science.
         I was born and raised in Texas but now reside in San Jose, California, by way
         of New York City, with my husband Josh and adorable dog Einstein. </p>
